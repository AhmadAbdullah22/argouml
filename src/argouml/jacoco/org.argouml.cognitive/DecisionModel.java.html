 * The DecisionModel is part of the state of the Designer.  It

 * certain importanance at a certain time, but I have not followed
 * through on that because I don't have good examples of how to
 * quantify the importance of a decision.

 * TODO: Right now the individual decisions are just
 * Strings, maybe they should have some non-atomic structure?
