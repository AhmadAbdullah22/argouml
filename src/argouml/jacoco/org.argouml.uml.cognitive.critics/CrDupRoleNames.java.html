     * &lt;p&gt;We do not handle association roles, which are a subclass of
     *   association. An association role should be fine, if its parent is OK,
     *   since it must have the same or fewer ends than its parent.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;. ArgoUML does not currently have a constructor to check
     *   that an association role is more tightly constrained than its
     *   parent.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;Then loop through the ends, building a list of end names that we
     *   have seen, and looking to see if the current end is already in that
     *   list. We ignore any ends that are unnamed, or have the empty string
     *   as name.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;Whilst this is an O(n^2) algorithm, most associations have only two
     *   ends, so this is unlikely to cause difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * @param  dm    the {@link java.lang.Object Object} to be checked against
     *               the critic.
     *

     *               creating the model. Not used, this is for future
     *               development of ArgoUML.
