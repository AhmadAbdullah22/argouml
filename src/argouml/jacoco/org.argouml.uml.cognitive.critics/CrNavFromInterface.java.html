     * Applies to Associations only, not AssociationRoles. The reason is
     * that an AssociationRole cannot have greater navigability than the
     * Association it specializes, so if the critic has addressed the
     * Association, the AssociationRole will effectively be addressed. There
     * may of course be a need for a critic to check that Association Roles do
     * match their parents in this respect!&lt;p&gt;
     *
     * As a consequence, we also don't need to check for associations with
     * ClassifierRoles.&lt;p&gt;

     * &lt;ol&gt;
     *   &lt;li&gt;There is an end connected to an Interface; and
     *   &lt;li&gt;An end other than that end is navigable.
